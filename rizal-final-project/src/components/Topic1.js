            The arrival of Jose Rizal in Manila on June 26, 1892 caused a great deal of excitement among the people of the Philippines. Because of his popularity, the Spaniards were afraid of him, and as a result, they watched his every move very carefully. All of the homes where he had been searched, and any Filipinos who were seen in his company, were considered to be suspects. In accordance with his plans, he established the La Liga Filipina on July 3, 1892. The event took place in the home of Doroteo Ongjunco in Tondo, Manila.

        <strong>Rizal's House at Dapitan </strong><br/>
        It so happened that a lottery ticket he had purchased won him a prize of 6,000 pesos, all of which he spent in Dapitan. He had purchased the ticket in Dapitan. He purchased sixteen hectares of land along the bay a few hundred meters east of the town of Dapitan, and on this land he built himself a small house.

        <strong>Rizal's Workshop for his students</strong> <br/>
        Rizal established a school in the year 1893. It started out with three students and eventually increased to a total of 16 students. His students did not have to pay any tuition. He put them to work in his garden, fields, and on community construction projects rather than collecting tuition from them. Reading, writing, languages (including Spanish and English), geography, history, mathematics (including arithmetic and geometry), industrial work, nature study, morals, and gymnastics were all subjects that Rizal instructed his sons in. They learned how to collect specimens of plants and animals, how to love working, and how to "behave-like-men" as a result of his training.

          In Dapitan, Rizal engaged in a religious scholarly debate with Father Pablo Pastells. This heated debate revealed Rizal's anti-Christianity - his resentment of friars who committed atrocities in the name of the sacred religion. Father Pastells made every effort, fortunately or unfortunately, in vain, to win Rizal back to the faith. These debates ended inconclusively, with neither of them persuaded of the other's judgments/arguments.

        Rizal made the most of his time in Dapitan by working on his artistic and literary skills, doing agricultural and civic projects, engaging in business activities, and writing letters to his European friends, particularly Ferdinand Blumentritt and Reinhold Rost. His careers and accomplishments in various fields were as follows:
        As a physician, Rizal provided free medicine to his patients, the majority of whom were impoverished. He did, however, have wealthy patients who compensated him well for his excellent surgical skills. Don Ignacio Tumarong gave Rizal 3000 pesos for restoring his sight, an Englishman gave him 500 pesos, and Aklanon haciendero Don Francisco Azcarraga paid him a cargo of sugar. His abilities were put to the test in August 1893, when his mother, Doa Teodora Alonzo, underwent ophthalmic surgery for the third time. The operation was a success, but Alonzo disobeyed her son's instructions and removed the bandages from her eyes, causing irritation and infection. <br/><br/>
        Rizal's knowledge as an engineer was put to use in the waterworks system, he built in Dapitan. Returning to his academic career, Rizal was awarded the title of expert surveyor (perito agrimensor) by the Ateneo Municipal. He supplemented his practical knowledge as an agrimensor by reading engineering-related books. As a result, despite the inadequacy of the tools at his disposal, he was able to provide a good water system in the province.
        Rizal, as an educator, founded a school in Dapitan that was attended by 16 young boys from prominent families. Instead of charging them for matriculation, he made them do community service projects for him, such as maintaining his garden and field. He taught them English and Spanish reading and writing, geography, history, mathematics, industrial work, nature study, morals, and gymnastics. He encouraged his students to participate in sports in order to strengthen their bodies. There was no formal room, as there is in a typical classroom today. From 2 p.m. to 4 p.m., classes were held with the teacher sitting on a hammock and the students sitting on a long bamboo bench. <br/><br/>
        Rizal spent time as an agriculturist planting important crops and fruit-bearing trees on his 16-hectare farm (later, reaching as large as 70 hectares). He grew cacao, coffee, sugarcane, and coconuts, among other things. He even put a portion of his earnings as a doctor and his 6000-peso lottery winnings into real estate. He imported agricultural machinery from the United States and taught modern agricultural methods to Dapitan's native farmers. Rizal also imagined an agricultural colony in Sitio Ponot, within Sindagan Bay. He thought the area was suitable for cattle-raising and cash crops because it had plenty of water. Unfortunately, this plan did not come to fruition. <br/><br/>
        Rizal was little known as an inventor. During his medical practice in Calamba in 1887, he invented a special type of lighter known as sulpukan, which he gave to Blumentritt as a gift. The mechanism of the wooden lighter, according to Rizal, was based on the principle of compressed air. Another of his inventions was the wooden brick-maker, which can produce approximately 6,000 bricks per day.
        As a linguist, Rizal was interested in the languages spoken in Dapitan, so he studied and compared the Bisayan and Malayan languages spoken in the area. Rizal spoke Tagalog, Ilocano, Bisayan, Subanun, Spanish, Latin, Greek, English, French, German, Arabic, Malayan, Hebrew, Sanskrit, Dutch, Catalan, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, Swedish, and Russian. <br/><br/>
        Rizal, as a scientist, shared his love of nature with his students. They explored the jungles with his boys, looking for specimens to send to museums in Europe, particularly the Dressed Museum. In exchange, European scientists sent him scientific books and surgical instruments. He also conducted extensive research and studies in ethnography, archaeology, geology, anthropology, and geography.

        Rizal had always missed his family and their happy times together in Calamba, and his grief was compounded by the news of Leonor Rivera's death. To his surprise, an Irish girl soon enlightened his rather bleak heart. This girl was Josephine Bracken, an 18-year-old who, in the words of Wenceslao Retana, was "slender, a chestnut blond, with blue eyes, dressed in elegant simplicity, with an atmosphere of light (gaiety)." <br/><br/>
        In February 1895, she arrived in Dapitan with his blind foster father, George Taufer, and a Filipina named Manuela Orlac from Hongkong. Rizal's reputation as an ophthalmic surgeon had spread internationally, and one of Rizal's friends, Julio Llorente, referred the group to Rizal. <br/><br/>     
        Rizal and Bracken fell in love right away and agreed to marry in just one month, which shocked and disturbed Taufer. However, the parish priest of Dapitan, Father Pedro Obach, refused to do so unless the Bishop of Cebu approved. <br/><br/>
        Taufer, on the other hand, returned to Hong Kong uncured. Because no priest would marry the couple, they exchanged vows before God in their own way, which scandalized Fr. Obach. Their love bore fruit in 1896 when Josephine became pregnant. Bracken gave birth to a one-month premature baby boy who died after only three hours. The child was named Francisco after Rizal's father and buried in Dapitan.

          Before the revolution began, Katipunan leader Andres Bonifacio sought advice from Jose Rizal. On May 2, 1896, the group agreed in a secret meeting at Pasig's Bitukang Manok river to send Dr. Pio Valenzuela as a representative to Dapitan to inform Rizal of their plan to launch a revolution against the Spaniards. Valenzuela boarded the steamer Venus on June 15, 1892 and arrived in Dapitan six days later with a blind companion, Raymundo Mata. In the evening, Rizal and Valenzuela talked in the former's garden. Valenzuela informed him of the Katipunan's plan. Rizal was outspoken in his opposition to Bonifacio's "premature" idea for two reasons: <br/><br/></p>
          <p>
          <ol>
            <li>The Filipinos had not yet prepared for such a bloody revolution; and</li>
            <li>The Katipunan lacked machinery - before planning a revolution, sufficient arms and funds must be gathered.</li>
          </ol>
          </p>
          <p>
          Valenzuela also informed Rizal of their plan to bring him back to Dapitan. Again, the exiled hero objected because he had no intention of breaking his word to the Spanish authorities.

          During the height of the Cuban revolution, Rizal offered his services as a military doctor to compensate for the country's physician shortage. Ferdinand Blumentritt, a friend of his, informed him of the situation in Cuba and suggested that he volunteer as an army doctor. Rizal sent a letter to Governor General Ramon Blanco on December 17, 1895, expressing his willingness to serve Cuba. But after months of waiting for the governor's response, Rizal gave up hope that his request would be granted. Only on July 30, 1896 did Rizal receive a letter from Governor Blanco accepting his offer, dated July 2, 1896. Rizal will also be given a pass to travel to Manila and then to Spain, where the Minister of War will assign him to the Army of Operations in Cuba.

          Jose Rizal boarded the steamer España at midnight on July 31, 1896, with Narcisa, Josephine, Angelica (Narcisa's daughter), three nephews, and six of his students. Many people were saddened when Dapitan's adopted son left. <br/><br/>He raised his hand in farewell to the kind and hospitable people of Dapitan, saying: " Adios, Dapitan!" He gazed at the crowded shore for the last time. His heart was filled with sorrow. When he could no longer see the dim shoreline, he turned sadly into his cabin.

          Dr. Jose Rizal is widely regarded as the country's national hero by many Filipinos. This is despite the fact that no law or legislation recognizes any Filipino historical figure as a national hero to this day. As a national hero, Rizal is elevated above other Filipino heroes who have also given their lives for the country. Fame and popularity are not the only benefits of such recognition; Jose Rizal is also the Philippines most 'questioned' hero. Along with Dr. Jose Rizal's status as the Philippines' National Hero, there are issues and controversies that call into question and, to some extent, negate his heroism. The debate over this has yet to be resolved and is still ongoing. At the moment, many Filipinos have mixed feelings about Jose Rizal and his heroism.

       <h3 className='title'>CONCLUSION</h3>
       <p>
        No action has been taken since the National Heroes Committee submitted its report/recommendations to then Secretary Ricardo T. Gloria of the Department of Education, Culture, and Sports on November 22, 1995. This was most likely due to the possibility of a flood of requests for proclamations. Another possibility is that the proclamations will spark heated debates about historical controversies surrounding the heroes.

       <h3 className='title'>RETRACTION CONTROVERSY </h3>

        <p>
          Four documents were discovered that contained Jose Rizal's retraction a day before his execution. Jose Rizal's rejection of masonry is stated in the retraction, as is his repudiation of his words, writings, publication, and conduct that were against the Catholic Church. Jose Rizal's alleged retraction was a requirement for him and Josephine Bracken to marry. <br/> <br/>
          Scholars who question the existence and authenticity of Jose Rizal's alleged retraction argue that it is a forgery based on handwriting analysis, the existence of multiple versions of the document, the alleged confession of the forger, and discrepancies in the contents of the various versions of the document. They also questioned the document's existence, pointing out that no member of Rizal's family had seen it, that it did not save Rizal from execution, and that there is no public record of Rizal and Bracken's marriage.

        </p>
        <h3 className='title'>AMERICAN SPONSORSHIP </h3>

        <p>
        Renato Constantino argued in his seminal work, Veneration Without Understanding, that Rizal's preeminence among our heroes was partly due to American sponsorship, citing laws enacted by Americans that ‘reduced' the role of other historical figures in our history in order to emphasize the role of Jose Rizal. He contended that the Americans elevated Jose Rizal above other heroes by enacting laws such as Act No. 137, which established the Rizal province, Act No. 243, which authorized the construction of the Rizal Monument in Luneta, and Act No. 346, which established December 30 as Rizal Day. He also claimed that Rizal was chosen because his image of peace and compromise, as well as the perception that he never advocated for independence, suited their (American) imperialistic interests in the Philippines.  <br/> <br/>
        On the other side of the debate, Professor Ambeth Ocampo, a known Rizal 'expert,' refuted Constantino's claims, claiming that Jose Rizal was already venerated long before the Americans sponsored him, citing President Emilio Aguinaldo's December 20, 1898 proclamation designating December 30 as a National Day of Mourning in honor of Jose Rizal. He claimed that "the Americans simply built on the people's prevailing sentiment" toward Rizal. They used Rizal's anti-Spanish, assimilationist, reformist, and peace-loving stance to advance their colonial/imperialistic agenda. 
        </p>
        <h3 className='title'>WAS RIZAL ANTI-REVOLUTION? </h3>

        <p>
        According to historian Renato Constantino, Rizal was an anti-revolutionary who betrayed the Philippines on two occasions: when he volunteered to serve as a doctor for the Spanish armies in the Cuban revolution and when he issued his December 15, 1898 letter in which he not only denied his participation in the revolution but also condemned it as disastrous and a waste of lives. Other historians and scholars point to Rizal's assimilate stance as evidence of his anti-revolutionary beliefs.  <br/> <br/>
        Professor Floro Quibuyen argued in his book A Nation Aborted: Rizal, American Hegemony, and Philippine Nationalism that Rizal was a revolutionary. He cited several pieces of evidence, including Rizal's letters explaining his ideas about the revolution and Dr. Pio Valenzuela's most recent testimony. He also provided a different reading and interpretation of Jose Rizal's Dec 15 manifesto, noting that he did not oppose the revolution but saw it as premature and lacking proper preparations. He contended that in Rizal's final poem, he praised revolutionaries, and that this poem became an inspiration for revolutionaries. He also contended that Jose Rizal could not be anti-revolutionary because many of his family members were members of the Katipunan and held important positions in it.
        </p>
        <h3 className='title'>WAS RIZAL AN AMBIVALENT HERO OR FENCE SITTER?</h3>

          <p>
          Four contradictory testimonies of Pio Valenzuela (2 in 1896 while a prisoner in Fort Santiago) and in 1914 and 1917 contributed to the perception of Jose Rizal as an ambivalent hero. These testimonies all revolve around his meeting with Jose Rizal in Dapitan. The first two testimonies state that Rizal completely rejected the revolution, whereas the other two claim that Rizal did not completely reject the revolution and had given instructions to the Katipunan to ensure the rebellion's success.  <br/> <br/>
          Some historians argue that Rizal was ambivalent, citing works in which he rejected armed struggle as a means of social transformation and others in which he expresses his support for the revolution. Some historians, on the other hand, argued that in order to determine whether or not Rizal was ambivalent, Jose Rizal must be read in the proper context and perspective. They also contended that Jose Rizal was a product of his time and society, and thus Rizal must be read in the context of 19th-century Philippines and from the perspective of Filipinos at the time.
          </p>
          <h3 className='title'>IS RIZAL STILL RELEVANT?</h3>

            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                Jose Rizal is still relevant because the social problems or "ills" that he exposed, criticized, and attempted to solve persist. Corruption, injustice, unqualified and/or incompetent government officials, and poverty are all persistent problems in the Philippines.
                </li>
                <li>
                Jose Rizal's characteristics are admirable. He serves as a role model and inspiration for Filipino youth to love and serve their country and fellow citizens.
                </li>
                <li>
                Studying Jose Rizal and the history of the country makes us aware of the ideals upon which our country was founded. Studying our forefathers' sacrifices for our country's freedom and sovereignty fosters nationalism and pride in our national identity.
                </li>
                <li>
                Jose Rizal will always play an important role in the evolution of Philippine nationalism.
                </li>
